# Script Title

Add a jpeg/png/gif file here if applicable

<!--An image is an illustration for your project, the tip here is using your sense of humour as much as you can :D 

You can copy paste my markdown photo insert as following:

## üõ†Ô∏è Description
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
This is a simple code that I wanted to make for quite a while, which is converting strings into cute Animal Crossing language, known as Animalese.

Animalese consists on basically spelling every letter of the phrase very quickly, creating an interesting distortion.

That said, it also means that different languages may create different sounds. If you are comfortable on sharing your voice, this mini project could become somewhat even cooler.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
Modules required to be able to use the script successfully
and how to install them.
(If there are a lot of them, including a `requirements.txt` file will work better.)

## 🐾 Animal Translator – Decode Pet Sounds with Python

Ever wondered what your pet is trying to tell you? **Animal Translator** is a fun and experimental Python-based project that aims to detect, analyze, and interpret common pet sounds (like barks or meows) and map them to probable meanings or emotions using audio processing and machine learning.

### 🚀 Features

* 🎤 **Audio Input**: Record or upload pet sounds (e.g., barking, meowing)
* 🧠 **Sound Classification**: Uses pre-trained ML models to classify audio into categories like "hungry", "playful", "angry", etc.
* 📊 **Visualization**: Displays waveform and spectrogram of the sound
* 🗣️ **Text Output**: Shows the predicted emotion or message

### 🛠️ Built With

* `Python`
* `Librosa` – for audio processing
* `Scikit-learn` / `TensorFlow` – for ML models
* `Matplotlib` – for sound visualization
* `Flask` (optional) – to create a simple web app interface

```

### 🧪 How It Works

1. Extract MFCC or other audio features using `Librosa`
2. Feed features into a trained classifier (e.g., Random Forest, CNN)
3. Output a label based on learned patterns from labeled pet sound data
